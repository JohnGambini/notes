# notes about notes
This is a very early version of a notes website based on the workbench framework. The workbench framework has evolved into an application framework for a site that has a lot of web pages that need to be arranged in some sensible fashion. The delineation between notes and workbench is that notes is the folder that contains the index file for the site along with directories for the content's images and the directories for various themes while  workbench is the code base that caches the content management database and provides a menuing system as well as a selection of page types to the user interface. You won't find any website using either workbench or notes because I haven't put one up yet. While I started these projects so that I could keep track of notes that I was keeping and wanted to keep - I've ended up spending most of my time on the code and very little on the content - that is, I haven't spent much time on the actual notes themselves. So, while the workbench framework is progressing, I still have very little content to actually post. Further, the workbench framework itself still needs work so that it provides adequate security for a public site. Like with the workbench framework, notes is here on github so that I can take advantage of the version control and so that I have backup for the code and content.
